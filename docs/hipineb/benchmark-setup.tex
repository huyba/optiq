\subsection{Synthetic benchmarks}
We evaluated our approaches through a set of 91 experiments on Mira, varying the partition size from 512 nodes to 4096 nodes. We varied the number of sources and destinations, and the average distance between them. We also experimented with different data sizes to be transferred. We show results for various combinations of source-destination pairs. The number of shortest paths used by our approaches was 50 paths per pair.
