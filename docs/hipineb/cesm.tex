\subsection{Introduction}

Community Earth System Model (CESM) is a coupled global climate model simulating the earth system consisting ice, land, ocean, atmospheric and other components \cite{CESM:Hurrell}. In order to provide flexibility in developing, models in CESM do not communicate directly with each other but via a coupler. The Figure \ref{fig:mct} shows the communication between 4 models: Atmosphere (ATM), Ice (ICE), Land (LND) and Ocean (OCN) with the Coupler (CPL).

In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework via data movements between the models and the coupler extracted from a real run of CESM.
