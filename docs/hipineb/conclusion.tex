\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we proposed two approaches for balancing load on the Blue Gene/Q supercomputer interconnection network using multi-paths for data movement. We realized our approaches in a framework and demonstrated the efficacy of our work through a set of benchmarks. Overall, OPTIQ gained higher throughput than default MPI\_Alltoallv. Performance can be improved up to several times. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our framework with real communication patterns and data from CESM gaining 30\% throughput improvement. Our work shows that to improve data movement performance we need to take advantage of both the applications' data movement patterns and system routing algorithms. In future we plan to study these approaches in the Cray XE6 supercomputer with adaptive routings and test them with real applications.
