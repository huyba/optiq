\section{Introduction}
Simulation time in a supercomputer depends partially in achivable networking performance in the supercomputer. The achievable networking performance in its turn depends on the exact combination of communication patterns of applications and routing algorithms used by the supercomputer. However, while the communication patterns have wider spectrum and vary from application to applicaiton, the routing algorithms have a limited variation and usually are optimized for typical communication patters. This results in high networking performance for favored communication patterns but poor networking performance for other communication patterns. Reducing the communication time for those non-favored communicaiton pattern eventually reduces the running time of an application. Thus, improving the networking performance for the communication patterns are important in redecing simulation time. 



Load balancing, routing, application communication patterns.

In this work, we propose a set of approaches that improve network performance for applications in Blue Gene/Q supercomputers.
