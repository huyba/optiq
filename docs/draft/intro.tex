\section{Introduction}

Achievable networking performance in a supercomputer depends on the exact combination of communication patterns of applications and routing algorithms used by the supercomputer. However, while the communication patterns have wider spectrum and vary from application to applicaiton, the routing algorithms have a limited variation
and usually are optimized for typical communication patters. This results in high networking performance for well-optimized communication patterns but poor networkin
g performance for other communication patterns.

Load balancing, routing, application communication patterns.

In this work, we propose a set of approaches that improve network performance for applications in Blue Gene/Q supercomputers.
