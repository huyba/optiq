In our previous works in \cite{Vishwanath:GLEAN}, \cite{SDAV:Bui2014b}, \cite{hbui:bgq} we have already presented our approaches for improving the performance of data movement for certain cases very dense in I/O case, or very sparse in p2s2. In this paper, we give solution for medium dense communication patterns between M and N.
