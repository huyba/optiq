\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we propsed two approaches for balancing load on the Blue Gene/Q supercomputer using multipaths for data movement. We realized our approaches into a framework and demonstrated the efficacy of our works through a set of benchmarks. Overall, we improved the throughput by 40\% to more than 60\% on average for 3 different patterns in 91 experiments in up to 4096-node partitions. The performance however, can be improved up to 4X. Our work shows that to improve data movement performance, we need to take advantage of both applications' data movement patterns and system routing algorithms. For future, we plan to study the approaches in the Cray XE6 supercomputer and tested in real applications.
