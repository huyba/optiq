\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we proposed two approaches for balancing load on the Blue Gene/Q supercomputer using multipaths for data movement. We realized our approaches in a framework and demonstrated the efficacy of our work through a set of benchmarks. Overall, we improved throughput by 40\% to more than 60\% on average for three different patterns in 91 experiments in up to 4096-node partitions. Performance, however, can be improved up to 4X. Our work shows that to improve data movement performance we need to take advantage of both the applications' data movement patterns and system routing algorithms. In future we plan to study these approaches in the Cray XE6 supercomputer and test them with real applications.
