\subsection{Model Optimization Approach}
\label{sec:optimization}

In this approach, we need to search for an assignment of data amount for each path that result in highest performance of data movement. Inputs are a set of pairs of source and destination, for each pair we have an amount of data needed to transfer from the source to the destination and k shortest paths between the source and destination.

We model the problem as searching for flow values in order to  minimize transfer time for multiple commodities using pre-determined multiple flows in a network given the amount of comodities and the capacities in links of the network. 

\input{approach-ampl}

The model takes a set of nodes, a set of arcs and their corresponding capacity, a set of jobs (source/destination pairs), a demand for each job, a set of paths for each job, and a set of arcs for each path as inputs. It searches for an assignment of flow values (proportional capacity) for paths of all the jobs such that the transfer time for demands of all jobs is minimum.

We feed the model into solvers together with data of nodes, arcs, capacity, paths for jobs and get the paths with given proportional bandwidth. Based on proportional bandwidth, each path can take proportional demand of a job.

We realize algoirthms and other implementation in a framework named OPTIQ.
