\begin{abstract}
Achievable networking performance in a supercomputer depends on the exact combination of communication patterns of applications and routing algorithms used by the supercomputer. However, while the communication patterns usually have wide spectrum and vary from application to applicaiton and phase to phase in an application, the routing algorithms have a limited variation and usually are optimized for typical communication patters. This results in high networking performance for favored communication patterns but low networking performance for other communication patterns. In this paper, we introduce approaches for improving networking performance by rebalancing load on physical links on the Blue Gene Q supercomputer. We realize our approaches into a framework called OPTIQ and demonstrate the efficacy of our framework via a set of benchmarks. The results show that we can achieve serveral times higher bandwidth than default mechannism MPI used in the Blue Gene Q supercomputer for certain communication patterns.
