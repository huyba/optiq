\subsection{MPI Paths Reconstruction}

In our experiment we need to measure not only the performance of MPI routines, but also loads on physical links, and the number of hops per path that MPI takes to move data from a set of sources to a set of destination. The load and hops informatoon can reveal details on performance differences between MPI and our framework OPTIQ. Thus reconstructing MPI's paths is necessary to get load and hops information.

We reconstruct MPI's paths based on our understanding of default routing algorithms described in \cite{Chen:BGQ}. For each pair of source and destination we start at a source node and follow the rules of the routing algorithm to move data from the source node to its destination. We then record paths for all the pairs and use them to calculate load and number of hops.
