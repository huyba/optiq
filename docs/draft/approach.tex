\subsection{Heuristic Approach}

Given the set of k shortest paths \textit{k\_paths} for each pair of communication, we need to select paths to be used for data movement to result in high performance. In this approach, we assume that each path carries similar amount of data. Thus, number of paths using a link can represent data load of the link. In order to avoid overloading on physical links and achieve high performance, we select paths in such a way that satisfies 2 conditions: (1) the number of paths for any pair of source/destination is as many as possible and (2) the maximum number of paths using any physical link is less than a given \textit{maxload} value. While the first condition gives us more choices of paths, the second condition gives us control over max load on physical links. One exhaustive approach is to go through all combinations of paths for all pairs to examine the 2 conditions to find the best combination. However, its time complexity is exponential. We propose a heuristic algorithm that can produce the set of paths while examining much less combinations. Our approach keeps iterating through all pairs of source/destination to search for more paths to use until the maximum of loads on links reach to the \textit{maxload} value. The approach is presented in \textbf{Algorithm} \ref{alg:heu}. The detail of the algorithm is explained as follows.

\begin{algorithm}[!htbp]
\textbf{Input:} Set of pairs of source-destination (\textit{s$_i$, d$_i$}) and their \textit{k\_paths}. \textit{maxload}\\
\textbf{Output:} Set of paths: \textit{selected\_paths} for data movement\\

    \begin{algorithmic}
        \State queue$<$struct path$>$ \textit{selected\_paths};\\
	int[][] loads: loads of all physical links, init to 0s.\\
    \end{algorithmic}
Main:
\begin{algorithmic}
    \Function {Heuristic\_search}{}
	\While{!(run out of paths || go over \textit{maxload})}
	\For {each pair of source-dest (\textit{s$_i$}, \textit{s$_i$})}
	    \State Get the first path \textit{p} out of set \textit{k\_paths}.
	    \State Check if adding \textit{p} make the current load over \textit{maxload}.
	    \If {(Not over \textit{maxload})} 
		\State remove \textit{p} from \textit{k\_paths}.
		\State add \textit{p} into \textit{selected\_paths}.
		\State update load[][] with links used by \textit{p}.
	    \Else 
		\State check if there is at the current pair has at least one path.
		\If {(Not having any path)}
		    \State increase the \textit{maxload} by 1
		\Else
		    \State remove \textit{p} from \textit{k\_paths}.
		\EndIf
	    \EndIf
	\EndFor
	\EndWhile
    \EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\end{algorithm}

In the heuristic algorithm, inputs of the algorithm include pairs of source and destination together with their k shortest paths \textit{k\_paths} and an allowed \textit{maxload}. Output of the approach is a set of selected paths used for data movement. We maintain a table \textit{load}[][] of loads on all physical links, whenever a link (u,v) is used by a selected path its entry in the load table i.e. \textit{load}[u][v] is increased by 1. We save selected path in a queue \textit{selected\_paths}.

We iterate through all pairs of source/destination. For each pair of source/destination, we get the first path out of its set of \textit{k\_paths}. We check if adding the path to its \textit{selected\_paths} would make the maximum load in the \textit{load} table over \textit{maxload}. We check the load by going through all links used by the path and examine their current loads in the \textit{load} table in comparison with \textit{maxload}. If their current load adding by 1 is not over \textit{maxload} we then add the path \textit{p} into \textit{selected\_paths}, update the \textit{load} table and remove the path from \textit{k\_paths}. We iterate through all pairs and add at most one path per pair at a time. The algorithm completes when we either running out of paths to add or the maximum load of physical links in \textit{load} table is over \textit{maxload}.

In the algorithm, we also check if under the current \textit{maxload} a pair of source/destination is not able to add any paths for transferring data. If so, we increase the \textit{maxload} by 1 until we can add a path to the pair. We do so to make sure that we have at least 1 path to transfer data from its source to its destination.

In the \textbf{Agorithm} \ref{alg:heu} we aim on balancing the number of paths using physical link. We identify number of paths on a link to actual amount of data transferred on the link.  Thus, the data movement performs well if each path carries similar amount of data. In real applications, it is not always the situation. Due to different data sizes and different number of paths, data size per path can vary. In order to gain better performance, we need a better way to determine the amount of data to be transferred on each path. In the next section, we propose another approach that employs a mathematical model and solvers to in determining  amount of data to be transferred on each path.
