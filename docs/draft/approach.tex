\subsection{Heuristic Approach}
\label{sec:heuristic}

In this section we describe our heuristic to select paths for each source-destination pair, given the set of $k$ shortest paths $k\_paths$. In this approach we assume that same amount of data is transmitted over each path. Thus the total load on a link can be represented by the number of paths using the link. In order to avoid overloading of the physical links and to achieve high performance, we select paths in such a way that satisfies the following two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select as many paths as possible for any pair of source/destination. 
\item The maximum number of paths on any physical link is less than a given $maxload$ value.
\end{enumerate}
The above conditions ensure that we have multiple paths for each pair, and the load is balanced and it is within the upper limit of maximum load on the physical links. The brute force algorithm explores all combinations of paths for all source-destination pairs and examines the above two conditions in order to find the best set of paths. However its time complexity is exponential. We propose a heuristic that outputs a set of paths without exhaustively searching the entire search space. Our heuristic iterates through all pairs of source/destination nodes to search for more paths until the $maxload$ value is reached. The pseudocode of our approach is presented in Algorithm~\ref{alg:heu}. The function \texttt{HeuristicSearch} invokes \texttt{FindPaths} until paths for all source-destination pairs are found.

\label{alg:heu}
\end{algorithm}

The input to the algorithm includes the set of source-destination pairs $\mathcal{R}$ = \{(S, D) $|$ S, D $\in~N$\}, their $k$ shortest paths {$k\_paths$}, the maximum allowed load on a link $maxload$ and the link load matrix $load$. $load$ is a table of loads on all physical links. Whenever a link $l=(u,v)$ is selected by the heuristic the corresponding entry $load(l) (= load[u][v])$ is incremented by 1. The heuristic outputs a set of selected paths $s\_paths$ for data movement for each source-destination pair. 

\texttt{HeuristicSearch} finds paths for all source-destination pairs in $\mathcal{R}$. \texttt{FindPaths} is invoked until there exist some paths between all source-destination pairs. In \texttt{FindPaths}, we iterate through all pairs of source-destination in $\mathcal{R}$. For each source-destination pair, we select a path $p$ from $k\_paths$ (lines 3--5). The selected path is removed from the set $k\_paths_i$ (line 6), where $i$ is the index of the selected source-destination pair. A path from the source node to the destination node is a set of links through intermediate nodes. Let this set of physical links be denoted as $links$ (line 6). We check if adding $p$ to $s\_paths$ violates the load condition for links in $p$ (lines 8--10). If current load $load(l)$ on all links $l \in links$ is below $maxload$, the path $p$ is added to $s\_paths_i$ (line 9). Also, the $load$ table is updated for all links $l \in links$ (line 10). If all the $k$ shortest paths have been used for a pair, we remove the pair from $\mathcal{R}$ (lines 11--12). 

We iterate through all pairs and add at most one path per pair at a time. The function \texttt{FindPaths} returns when $k\_paths$ is empty for all source-destination pairs. At this point, we increase the maximum load limit $maxload$ by 1 and re-invoke \texttt{FindPaths} from \texttt{HeuristicSearch} (line 18).
