\subsection{Synthetic benchmarks}

%We carried our experiments on Mira, a Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. 
We evaluated our approaches on Mira, varying the partition size from 512 nodes to 4096 nodes. %The experiments involved a subset or the entire set of nodes for each partition. 
We varied the number of sources and destinations, and the average distance between them. 
We also experimented with different data sizes to be transferred. 
%We also varied the data sizes to be exchanged to find the effective data size.
We show results for various combinations of source-destination pairs. 
%Pairs of sources and destinations are randomized to show the efficacy of our work. 
The number of shortest paths used by our approaches was varied from 16 -- 50. % solvers to measure the effectiveness of number of paths to throughput. 
We also varied the maximum load $maxload$ for our heuristic approach. 
%A similar benchmark with various max load is done for the heuristic approach. 
%For searching optimal paths we used AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming) and its solvers \cite{AMPL} for modeling our problem, and to find solutions for optimal data movement.
