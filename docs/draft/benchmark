\section{Benchmarks}

\subsection{Experimental }
\subsubsection{Chunk size for pipeline}
\subsubsection{Various message sizes}
\subsubsection{Many ranks}
\subsubsection{Scaling}

\subsection{Communication patterns}
In this paper we demostrate data movement performance of our OPTIQ framework and existing MPI's routines on the following communication patters:

\begin{itemize}
\item All to many, many to all
\item I/O Aggregation: a special case of All to many (or many to many)
\item Many to many: disjoint/exclusive
\item Many to many: subset
\item Many to many: partially joint (not subset, not disjoint)
\item Many to many: sparse
\end{itemize}
