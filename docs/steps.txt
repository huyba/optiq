1. Step to generate data:
1.1 Generate 50 paths for each jobs using yen's algorithm:
- Complile and make sure that the execution is the lastest.
- Go into multiple/yen/yenpaths/
- For each configuration, go into the specified dirs such as 512, 1k, 2k...
- Make sure the parameters are correct.
- Excute to produce output file. For each test, each rank will find paths for a job and write to a file of test_testid_jobid.
- Excecute collect.sh to gather all jobs of a test to one file of test_testid.
- Check to make sure that there are 50 paths for each jobs.
- Files test_testid_jobid can be saved to use later.

1.2 Execute yen_model.x to generate model data from test data.

1.3 Upload model dat files to MCS machines, solve them.

1.4 After solving them, download back to machines and execute jobs with paths generated.

2. Heuristics:
2.1 Same to 1.1
2.2 Execute yen_gather.x to collect paths satisfying max load < 1 (or any specified number)
