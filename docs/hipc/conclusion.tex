\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%In this paper 
We proposed two approaches for balancing load on the Blue Gene/Q supercomputer using multiple paths for data movement. We realized our approaches in OPTIQ framework and demonstrated the efficacy of our work through a set of benchmarks. Overall, we improved throughput by 43\%--67\% on average for three different communication patterns in 91 experiments on up to 4096 nodes. %Performance, however, can be improved up to 4X. %what does this mean? 
Our work shows that to improve data movement performance we need to take advantage of both application's data movement patterns and system routing algorithms. In general, our Optimization approach outperforms heuristic and MPI\_Alltoallv due to better load-balanced multiple paths for data movement. In future, we plan to study these approaches on the Cray systems and  also evaluate with applications.
